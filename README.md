# tutored_project repository
An example of notebook used for the tutored project.

- The notebook CompGPNN.ipynb can be used to see the differences between the predictions of a gaussian process with EQ + Linear kernels and the best neural network for our problem.
- The notebook GP_Kernel_Optimization.ipynb can be used to look around the effect of kernel choices and parameter optimization towards the model and RMSE error
